# The-Bridge
Neurosky project Gamelab#3 , Floris de Haan, Justin Bieshaar<br>

My first game with Neurosky
We decided to create a game with neurosky mind wave technology where the player has to concentrate to 
keep their play-field big. If the attention meter is under 50% the background will turn black. This 
causes a smaller play-field.<br><br>

Please take a look at this code:<br><br>

[PlayerAttack](https://github.com/jscotty/The-Bridge/blob/master/Assets/scripts/player/PlayerAttack.cs)<br><br>

I used delegates for the first time with this project:<br>
[PlayerHandler](https://github.com/jscotty/The-Bridge/blob/master/Assets/scripts/player/PlayerHandler.cs)<br><br>

[Background ColorChanger component script](https://github.com/jscotty/The-Bridge/blob/master/Assets/scripts/props/ColorChanger.cs)<br><br>
[EnemyAttack](https://github.com/jscotty/The-Bridge/blob/master/Assets/scripts/enemy/EnemyAttack.cs)<br><br>

The enemy's are falling often from the bridge.<br>
